ng-trans.css
============

ng-trans.css is some transitions made for AngularJS.

To see demo, check out http://minipai.github.io/ng-trans.css/

##Requirements
You need AngularJS 1.2 with ngAnimate.

ng-trans.css works with directives that will add `.ng-leave`, `.ng-leave-active`, `.ng-enter` and `.ng-enter-active` CSS classes. This includes ngRepeat, ngInclude, ngIf, ngView.

##Usage
You only need to add class `ng-trans ng-trans-{{transType}} {{timingFuntion}}` to the element to make transition work.

```
<ul>
  <li class="ng-trans ng-trans-rotate easeOutBack" ng-repeat="item in data"></li>
</ul>
```

**Before v0.5.0 class needed to add to parent element. However, its changed to enable doing more fancy stuffs.**
